# MINTverse

**200,000Ã— faster.**  
**96 hours â†’ 90 seconds.**  
From simulation to ML emulation â€” decisions at the speed of thought.

### Why MINTverse

**Ingest. Estimate. Emulate.**  
One toolkit across **R** and **Python** to go from raw *malariasimulation* outputs to live, queryable dashboards and ML surrogates â€” fast.

## âœ¨ What you get

- **Ingest at scale** â€” turn bulky *malariasimulation* outputs into a lean, queryable store (DuckDB-ready).
- **Estimation models** â€” infer **EIR** and **cases/1000** from routine surveillance + coverage.
- **Emulators** â€” GRU/LSTM forecasters that run **in seconds** for scenario planning.
- **End-to-end orchestration** â€” reproducible pipelines from simulation to decision support.
- **Built for speed** â€” CPU/GPU-aware, minimal overhead, designed to ship.

## ðŸ§± Architecture

The ecosystem is modular: **simulate â†’ ingest â†’ estimate â†’ emulate â†’ orchestrate**.

## ðŸ§ª Design principles

- **Simple first.** Opinionated defaults; escape hatches everywhere.  
- **Fast by design.** Columnar storage, vectorized ops, and GPU where it counts.  
- **Reproducible.** Deterministic pipelines, documented seeds, and versioned data.  
- **Composable.** Small libraries that play well together (and alone).
